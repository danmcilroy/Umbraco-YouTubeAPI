# Daniel Mcilroy Web Developer Test
## Umbraco YouTube API

### End Solution
* A one page Umbraco Website (Umbraco v7 or v8)
* Use the Youtube API to retrieve videos from your playlist of choice.
* Save the retrieved content to Umbraco.
* Display the videos on the front end from the Umbraco Content.
* Allow the user to update the content by clicking a button on the front-end. (This should call the api and update the list of videos in the backoce, also displaying the latest videos to the user ).

### Comments
If given more time:
* I would write more unit tests for the Umbraco Controllers.
* Functionality wise I would add a textbox for the user to enter a YouTube playlistId, therefore showing them a list of videos from their chosen playlist.
